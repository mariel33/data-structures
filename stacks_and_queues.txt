1. The main difference between a stack and a queue is where the data structure is taking the next object from;
-A stack will take the top object (most recent)
-A queue is more like a first-come-first-serve line

2. Stacks and queues are alike in that they are both data structures that prioritize the next object to be processed.

3. The UNDO and REDO options in Word would use a stack, because the user is referring to their most recent action.

    var newString = [];
    for(let i = 0; i <= str.length; i++) {
        newString.push(str.charAt(str.length - i)); 
    } return newString.join('');
}
//test
console.log(reverseString("hello"));
console.log(reverseString("Bloc!"));
