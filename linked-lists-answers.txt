1. Linked lists are better to use in terms of memory; each node is independent in memory so it will only use available memory location to store it.
Arrays can be limited in size, but linked lists can grow to be very large.
However, accessing elements from within the list can be inefficient since you have to start at the first node.
Elements in an array can be accessed immediately by referencing the index of the element.

2. A real world example of a linked list would be a CD playing on an old CD player. 
You are not able to select the track you want to listen to.
instead you need to skip through each song starting at the beginning until you reach the song.

Programming Questions

1. 
 LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
     var node = new Node(element);
     var currentNode = this.head;
     if (currentNode === null) {
       this.head = node;
         } else {
       while (currentNode.next !== null) {
         currentNode = currentNode.next;
       }
       currentNode.next = node;
     }
};

2.
LinkedList.prototype.delete = function(node, previousNode) {
  previousNode.next = node.next;
};

LinkedList.prototype.removeDuplicates = function() {
    var previousNode = null;
    var currentNode = this.head;
    var existing = {};
    while (currentNode !== null) {
        if (!existing[currentNode.value]) {
         existing[currentNode.value] = 1;
      } else {
        this.delete(currentNode, previousNode);
      }
      previousNode = currentNode;
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
};

3.

LinkedList.prototype.reverseList = function() {
    currentNode = this.head;
    secondNode = currentNode.next;

    while(secondNode) {
        const temp = secondNode.next;
        secondNode.next = currentNode;
        currentNode = secondNode;
        secondNode = temp;
    }

    this.head.next = null;
    this.head = currentNode;
}
